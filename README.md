# Lectures for the Spring 2020 sections of FIN377 at Lehigh

- This repo is modified locally on my computer and pushed via GitHub desktop.
- The site is constructed from .ipynb files (**which are inside the `content` subfolder!**) using the wonderful `jupyter-book` repo. I've modified much of the formatting to fit the needs of the course and Lehigh's aesthetics.
- The amateur logo was designed by an amateur (me).
