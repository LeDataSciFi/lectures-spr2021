# Overview

Welcome! I'm glad you're here, and hope you find this class rewarding. This page is mostly "throat clearing", so let's get down to business!

Please note that while this site can be viewed on a phone, it is not optimized for that size, and some features and navigation elements might not appear. 

Important: This is a brand new class, so everything is an experiment. So the class (these notebooks, lecture plans, assignments, etc.) are likely to evolve and change throughout the semester quite a bit. Don't assume "Lecture 8" is going to look in April like it does in January!

Ok, when you're ready to go forward, hit the right arrow on your keyboard (or the link below pointing to the right, or the next section on the left sidebar). Let's go!
